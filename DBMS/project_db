- what is the need of the database?
    - to store triggers and actions at a centralised location
    - would be used in reconstruction of the logstash configuration file
    - Centralised datarepo is required to store the user manual triggers
- sqlite3 
 -  mysql vs sqlite3 
    - mysql is server based whereas sqlite is not
    - smaller (library is in KB whereas 600MB in mysql)
    - easy setup and ease of use for testing
 - issues of sqlite: 
    - user management (multiple user logins)
    - weaker security 
    - less efficient concurrency control 
- why not no-sql
 - dealing with relationships between the entites in an optimised way
 - transactions.. removal and addition of ml-triggers
 - We dont have large amount of unordered data.. which is a perfect usecase for no-sql
 - we have constraints for each attributes.. 

-  why not distributed database arch(a basic requirement for no sql db)?
    - would lead to time latencies which would increase the response time to the occuring fault in the system

- Keys in the designed db:
    - Trigger 
        SK& CK & PK = {name,parameter_name}
    - Action 
        SK & CK & PK = {name}
