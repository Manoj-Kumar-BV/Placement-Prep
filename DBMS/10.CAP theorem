- CAP
    - Consistency
    - Availability
    - Partition tolerence

- Theorem states that all 3 properties cant exist together in real world.
  Tradeoff between consistency and Availability when there's a partition

- CA
    - No partition
    - Not fault tolerant
    - deploy it on one node, using replication we can try to solve fault tolerance
- CP
    - Whenever there's a partiton, then read requests from the node are stopped until a    consistent replica of the db instance is obtained from the server
      Ex: Mongo DB
      Banking systems should be consistent always
- AP
    - eventually consistent
    - after the replicated data is updated to the read servers, consistency is regained
    - used in cases where buisness logics support inconsistency in read for a given period of time
    Ex: Cassandra, Amazon Dynamo DB

- BASE properties of db [social networking based dbs]
    - Basically Available
    - Soft state 
        - there can be many changes in the state of the db even if there are no interactions from the user. {Increase in likes overnight,,, ;>}
    - Eventually consistent
