- Clustering 
    - Horizontal scaling has a limitation 
    - Replica sets: Same db is copied to multiple servers. A collection of all this is     called one cluster
    - Why?
        - Redundancy!
            - Availability should be maintained
            - multiple servers are maintained for the service Availability
        - Load balancing
        - High Availability
    - CDN(Content Delivery Networks)
        - reduces latency
        - instead of a central server handling all requests, a geographically nearer server stores the required data and transmits it to the user
        - Growth of large online streaming platforms, Network Service Providers are deploying their own content distribution Networks

        - CDN vs Cloud: 
            - CDN provides content delivery from the origin server and replicates the data held in the main servers
            - Cloud is more on service based things: IaaS,SaaS,PaaS, which are connected to the network and provide services to the public

- Partitioning 
    - Problem:
        - When handling large amt of data and huge no of requests, a single system will not have all the resources to sustain it
        - Therefore its better to make it a distributed system
    
    - Solution:
        - Scale-up: Increase the system hardware 
        - Replica-set(Clustering): 
            - Master-Slave architecture:
                - Updates occur to a master and are propogated to the slaves
                - The slave system holds the same data as of the amster and it can serve for read requests
        - Partitioning (Scale-out):
            - New node is added and the data is also partitioned into different groups
            - Types:
                - Vertical Partitioning [column wise]
                - Horizontal Partitioning [row wise]
- Sharding 
    - Technique to partition data horizontally
    - [1 to 100] in one server and [101 to 200] in another server
    - Both servers are independent
    - Requires a routing layer in app layer to route the request to a particular shard.
    - Cons:
        - Routing layer is required
        - Non uniformity is formed [One particular shard will have more requests]
            - Solution: Reshard the db
