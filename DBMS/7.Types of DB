- Relational DB
    - Relational model is used
    - Issues:
        - Scalability
        - Data becomes huge, system becomes more complex
    - Ex: MySQL - matured, support is enormous
- No SQL
    - Refer to doc 6
- Object Oriented DB
    - Not that popular
    - Modelling of the scenario in an object oriented approach is necessary
    - Everything is defined and stored in terms of an object
    - handles -> ID of object
    - Stores structured Data
    - Methods are used to interact between objects
    Ex: Object DB, Gemstone

- Hierarchial DB    
    - Ex: Family tree
    - A parent table relation is always present [concrete hierarchy]
    - Parent can ahve multiple childs, but a child can have only one parent
    - Since disk storage is also a hierarchial strucure, can be used as physical models
    - Adv: 
        - Easy to use
        - Adding and deleting will be Easy
    - Disadv
        - Cant descibe complex relationships
        - Requires top to bottom sequential searching
        - traversal are very slow

    Ex: IBM IMS

- Network DB
    - Organised in graph type structure
    - child can have multiple parents
    - Maintainenece is tedious
    Ex: Integrated Data Store,IDBMS, Turbo Image
